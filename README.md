## Task 1: Understanding and Implementing the Verilog Code on FM
## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This project aims to understand and implement Verilog code on the [VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/vsdsquadron/). The primary tasks include reviewing and documenting Verilog code, creating a PCF (Pin Constraint File), and integrating the design onto the hardware using the provided datasheet.

# Step 1: Understanding the Verilog Code
This task involves analyzing the Verilog design, mapping pins, and flashing the code to the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board.
